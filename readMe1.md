## [JSL11] Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

### Project Overview

As a newly hired developer at Agile Board, a fictional company specializing in innovative task management solutions, you'll embark on an exciting journey to enhance their flagship Kanban Task Management App.

### Objectives

The journey through this project will involve several key activities:

1. **Exploring the Starter Code**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the UI and JS functionality we've provided. This will give you a solid understanding of the project's current state and what needs to be done.
2. **Completing User Stories**: Dive into the user stories, which are your roadmap to completing the project. Each story is a feature or functionality that your app needs to support. Your goal is to write the JS code necessary to bring these stories to life.
3. **Testing and Debugging**: As you implement each feature, test your app to ensure it works as expected. Debug any issues that arise to ensure a smooth user experience.
4. **Reflecting on Your Work**: Once you've completed the user stories, take a step back and review your app. Consider the challenges you faced, what you learned, and how you might improve the app further.

This project is designed to be both challenging and rewarding, providing you with hands-on experience in web development. By the end, you'll have a functional Kanban Task Management App that you can showcase in your portfolio. Ready to get started? Let's dive in!
